Folder structure:
+ jpg: images rescaled for viewing to 0..255
+ raw: raw 16bit pngs

Description:
Raw images are stored as uint16 pngs and are very dark. 
This is because the CCD camera's full well capacity is about 14.000 DU,
but the maximum pixel value for uint16 is 65535.

The dataset contains 3 images taken from 2 different fire lookout towers in Cyprus.

Images for viewing can be found in the jpg folder.
In MATLAB you can use imshow(img,[]) to scale and display a raw image.
